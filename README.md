# Otpify-Cybersecure-Based-2FA-Login-System
This project was developed as part of my college mini-project assignment. Itâ€™s a secure login system using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Nodemailer, with bcrypt password hashing and OTP-based two-factor authentication. Users log in with a password and verify via a time-limited OTP sent to their email for enhanced security.
